Brought to you by Luke Solomon, Justin Dambra, and Dave Boselli.

## What is Slouch?
We want to take the modern concussion test and bring it to your phone.
<br>
<br>
## What needs to be done?
1. Mockups need to be made into a basic storyboard (Luke)
2. Pages of the app need to be built (Justin)
3. Specs for the app need to be created (All 3)
4. Skeleton of the app needs to be made (Boselli)

## Have some pictures
We're still trying to get this to work. Markdown is hard.
